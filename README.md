## Technologies Used

The Multi-Step Form project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React.js:** The project is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based approach, allowing for modular and reusable code.

- **Create React App:** Create React App is a boilerplate tool that sets up a React.js project with a predefined folder structure and build configuration. It simplifies the setup process and allows for a quick start.

- **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is a library that simplifies the management of application state in React.js applications. It provides utilities and abstractions that reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to configure and use Redux.

- **CSS3:** The project utilizes plain CSS3 for styling and creating a visually appealing user interface.

- **Jest:** Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework used for unit testing. It is easy to set up and provides a wide range of testing utilities, making it suitable for testing React components and Redux actions.

## Features

The Multi-Step Form project includes the following features:

- **Multi-Step Form:** The form is divided into multiple steps, allowing users to navigate through each step and provide their information in a structured manner.

- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit is used for managing the application state. It provides a centralized store to manage form data and facilitates seamless communication between components.

- **Responsive Design:** The form is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. CSS3 is used to create a visually appealing layout that remains user-friendly across various devices.

- **Unit Testing:** The project includes unit tests written with Jest. These tests ensure the reliability and stability of the codebase, allowing for easier maintenance and refactoring in the future.

## Getting Started

To run the Multi-Step Form project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd multi-step-form`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and access the form at `http://localhost:3000`


This will run the Jest test runner and display the test results in the terminal.

## Conclusion

The Multi-Step Form project demonstrates my skills as a frontend developer, showcasing my proficiency in React.js, Redux Toolkit, CSS3, and Jest testing. The form's multi-step nature, form validation, state management, and responsive design highlight my ability to create user-friendly and visually appealing web applications.
